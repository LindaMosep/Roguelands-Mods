Description=Hardcore removes the feature that makes you unable to die if you are above 1 HP. This mechanic is rather overpowered, as it means that you can stay alive against anything as long as you keep your health above minimum.\nNormally, it still prevents you from being one-shot (killed in a single hit from full health). This can be disabled in the config.
